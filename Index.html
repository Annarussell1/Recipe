<h2>WHY BROWNIES?</h2>
<body>

	- Brownies are an easy, fun, and safe process that is a delicious sweet treat! Growing up, my grandma and I would bake different types of sweets and her brownies were my favorite. Doing this with my grandma, I learned and was able to make them myself, that keeping up with oven time and having a good consistency of ingredients is most important. Its something fast and simple for anyone who enjoys sweets especially brownies!
	
			<h2>-INGREDIENTS:</h2>
	
	<p>1 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 2/3 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla, 2 eggs, 3/4 cup flour, 1/2 cup canola oil, 2 tablespoons water, and 3/4 teaspoons salt.</p>
	
</p>
			
				
				<h2>-STEPS:</h2>
	Melt butter, combine with sugar, mix ingredients into a bowl, then pour evenly into an oven-safe pan. (8x8 dish)
	Preheat the oven to 320 degrees then bake for about 40-45 minutes! Let brownies cool completley before slicing.
	Adding choclate chips to your mixture before baking is a great idea to make your brownies better!
